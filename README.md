# Startpage

Minimalistic startpage designed to be fully customisable. Currently only supports modifying the link details and category header colours, but in future will be able to fully customize the theme and fonts.

### Motivation & Development

Startpages are traditionally created for purely personal use and written in simple HTML/CSS since links are very rarely updated. I wanted to actually LEARN something though, so I used a framework I hadn't used before: [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).

### Development

When developing use:
- `yarn dev`

A development server will run on `http://localhost:8000/`


To build the project use:
- `yarn build`

A web ready folder will be created in `/dist/web/`.
A browser addon/extension ready zip will be created in `/dist/extension/`.
